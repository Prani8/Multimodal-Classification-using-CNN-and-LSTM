# Multimodal Classification using CNN and LSTM

**Description:** Built and compared CNN and LSTM models to classify movie genres from poster images and text overviews.

**Tools Used:** TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NLP tools

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did
- Preprocessed text using tokenisation and vectorisation
- Built CNN model for image inputs and LSTM for text inputs
- Trained and evaluated both models separately
- Compared performance and proposed multimodal fusion
